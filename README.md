# Keyword Network Analysis and Word Frequency Analysis
# Objective:
The objective of this project is to perform keyword network analysis and word frequency analysis on a given dataset. The project aims to extract keyword data from the provided file and convert it into a weighted adjacency matrix. The following steps outline the process:

# Extract Keyword Data: 
The provided file is processed to extract keyword data for analysis.

Convert to Weighted Adjacency Matrix: The extracted keyword data is used to construct a weighted adjacency matrix, representing the relationships between keywords.

Convert Adjacency Matrix to Weighted Network: The weighted adjacency matrix is read and converted into a weighted network, facilitating further analysis.

Compute Node Degree and Strength: Node degree and strength are computed for each node in the network, providing insights into the importance and connectivity of keywords.

Top 10 Nodes by Degree and Strength: The top 10 nodes are identified based on their degree and strength within the network, highlighting the most influential keywords.

Top 10 Node Pairs by Weight: The top 10 node pairs are determined based on their weight, indicating the strongest relationships between keywords.

Plot Average Strength and Degree: An average strength vs. degree plot is generated, with average strength represented on the y-axis and degree on the x-axis. This visualization provides a comprehensive view of the network's structure and connectivity.

# Usage:
To execute the project:

Ensure you have the necessary dataset or file containing keyword data.
Run the provided code to perform keyword extraction, construct the weighted adjacency matrix, and conduct network analysis.
